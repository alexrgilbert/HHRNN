# Hungry, Hungry, Continuous-Variable Rate Recurrent Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository provides the code for the framework presented in [our exploration of interoceptive processing and cognitive models](). We apply the RNN models proposed in [this paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/45/22811) to model the behavioral dataset collected in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938422003699?via%3Dihub). We also explore how modifications can be made to the baseline architecture to account for interoceptive state (i.e. hunger).
